      `paiN Gaming and paiN X are two up and rising teams and are the masterpieces
      of Brazilian Dota 2. Finally South America has the attention it deserves. However,
      cheering for the Brazilian teams is not well documented so far. We asked a real SA
      expert to teach us five memes and chat phrases we can use in the future.

      `Set in the island city-state of Singapore, the PVP Esports Championship
      gets under way this weekend with $200,000 on the line for the Dota 2 victors.
      Who will take home the grand prize? Here’s our guide to proceedings.`,

      `tweetId='1047573506865549313'`,

      `<br>Billed as Singapore’s biggest esports event, the PVP Esports Championship has a
      raft of major sponsors. With that, big names are needed to justify the investment.
      Step up two of the biggest names in Dota 2 — Chinese The International 2018 runners-up
      PSG.LGD and European side Team Secret. <br/><br/>
      The Championships are split into three esports — Hearthstone, mobile title Arena of Valor,
      and Dota 2 — with a total prize pool of $300,000. The lion’s share of that goes to Dota 2,
      and with large prize pools, major teams come knocking. <br/><br/>`,

      `tweetId='1039538019731222530'`,

      `The event will be the LAN debut of Team Secret’s new-look roster, after the close-season additions
      of young Polish carry Michał 'Nisha' Jankowski and the Swede, Ludwig 'zai' Wåhlberg. <br/> <br/><br/>

      <h3>The best of the rest?</h3>
      Joining PSG.LGD and Secret are a third invited team, Fnatic. Daryl 'iceiceice' Koh will be looking to make a splash
      in his home country, and will certainly have the backing of a partisan crowd. <br/> <br/>

      Five of the other six teams in the SEA-focused event have all gone through qualifiers to earn their spots:
      <br/> <br/>
      — KSY, Australia
      — Team Admiral, Philippines
      — Resurgence, Singapore
      — Hashtag, Thailand
      — Signify, India
      — BOOM ID, winners of the Indonesia Games Championship 2018
      <br/><br/><br/>`,


      `
      <h3>Three stages to glory</h3>
      To kick things off, the six qualifiers will take part in a best-of-one round robin Group Stage.
      The teams finishing in the top three positions will then move on to the Playoff Group Stage.
      <br/><br/>

      Here, the three invited teams join the party. Due to the uneven nature of the event, a draw will
      be made to determine which groups the invited teams will populate.
      <br/><br/>

      Group A will be made up of the first and second place teams from the Group Stage, along with one
      invite, while Group B will feature the other two direct invites alongside the third place team from the round robin.
      <br/><br/>

      The top two teams from each of these groups will then move on to a single-elimination bracket —
      the semi-finals being played as a best-of-three series, and the Grand Finals a best-of-five.
      <br/><br/>

      Remember to get your Oracle predictions in if you’re following along!

      Who do you think will come out on top? `

      "Red Bull Esports are back with another weird Dota 2 event, Guardians, in which strategy — and substitutes — are the keys to victory.",

      `tweetId='1047049936540438528'`,

      `<h3>Extra heroes and in-game substitutes?</h3>
      A custom tournament format created by Red Bull for the event, Guardians offers an entirely different take on traditional 5v5 Dota.
       With the aim being to challenge the players in how they strategise, the format will feature two massive changes to the norm.<br/><br/>

      Firstly, there will be an additional draft and ban stage — with teams choosing three extra heroes that will
      act as ‘substitutes’ for the game — think football or basketball, for example.<br/><br/>

      Secondly, it will be possible to swap between heroes during the game — and the new hero will
      hold onto the same items and experience as the one being removed. Each player on the team will
      have a three-minute cooldown for the use of this ability.<br/><br/>

      It certainly sounds very much like how a roster is used in basketball, where players are hot-swapped
      in and out several times during a match. However, with Guardians it is not the players themselves being
      removed, but the heroes on the field of battle. <br/><br/>

      <h3>Two invites announced, two to go</h3>
      Four teams in total will be invited to take part in the tournament, which runs from 19-20 October and will
      be held at Red Bull’s all-purpose esports facility in London — the Red Bull Gaming Sphere. <br/><br/>

      So far, two of the teams have been confirmed, with Brazil’s paiN Gaming and SEA stars Mineski set to do
      battle in the double-elimination tournament. <br/><br/>

      The additional strategic element to being able to hot-switch heroes is certainly going to provide some
      fascinating viewing — and you can catch all the action on Red Bull’s Twitch channel.<br/>

      `Hometown hero Daryl 'iceiceice' Koh was unable to lead his Fnatic team to victory in Singapore
      as an epic Grand Final saw Team Secret claim the $80,000 first prize. <br/>`,

      `tweetId='1048938296481603584'`,

      `<h3>Nisha goes big as Grand Final goes all the way</h3>
      Having brought in young Polish prospect Michał 'Nisha' Jankowski in the off-season, Team Secret were
      looking to hit the ground running in their first event of 2018-19, and it was the carry who would
      lead them to the win — and his first LAN win. <br/> <br/>

      The Grand Final went the distance at the Suntec Convention Centre. Fnatic drew first blood, taking
      a 35 minute game with iceiceice leading the way. However, Secret bounced back with a pair of wins —
      including a patient, one-hour win in which they led pretty much the entire game thanks to Nisha
      showing what he was capable of — he recorded figures of 29-3-26 across the two games.<br/> <br/>

      Fnatic were not done. They roared back into the series with a dominant win of their own, sending the
      Grand Final into a decider. With toplaner Yeik Nai 'MidOne' Zheng leading the charge, they led from
      start to finish as they polished off the game in less than half an hour, sealing the championship
      and leaving iceiceice to settle for runner-up. <br/><br/>

      <h3>Fnatic show intent in Group Stage</h3>
      It was a measure of revenge for Team Secret. Earlier in the tournament it was Fnatic who had drawn
      first blood between the two sides, as they won the opening game of the Playoff Group Stage in a topsy
      turvy best-of-one match. Fnatic had also taken down Signify, winning a one-sided match to top the
      group. Secret also defeated Signify. <br/><br/>

      In the other group, PSG.LGD predictably sealed first place. However, they were given runs for
      their money by both BOOM ID and Team Admiral, and it was the latter who qualified for the
      semi-finals alongside the Chinese side. <br/><br/>

      <h3>Secret dominate against PSG.LGD</h3>
      The Chinese side came thoroughly undone once they faced off against stronger opposition. In a
      20-minute first game, Secret absolutely dismantled PSG.LGD, winning by a 30-7 margin and a net
      worth advantage of over 20k. <br/><br/>

      The second game wasn’t much different, either. In fact, it was an even quicker and more dominant
      victory. For the second game in a row three players from PSG.LGD failed to record a single kill,
      and the 18-minute win was wrapped up by a margin of 20-3 and 16.5k lead.<br/><br/>

      In the other semi-final, Fnatic sealed their place in the Grand Final by taking down Admiral with
      a pair of comfortable matches lasting just over an hour in total.
      Overall it was an impressive showing from the new-look SEA side, one which bodes well for the upcoming Major. <br/><br/>


      <h4>Can Secret and Fnatic make a bigger impact on the DPC this season? </h4>`
