    Billed as Singapore’s biggest esports event, the PVP Esports Championship has a
    raft of major sponsors. With that, big names are needed to justify the investment.
    Step up two of the biggest names in Dota 2 — Chinese The International 2018 runners-up
    PSG.LGD and European side Team Secret. <br/><br/>
    The Championships are split into three esports — Hearthstone, mobile title Arena of Valor,
    and Dota 2 — with a total prize pool of $300,000. The lion’s share of that goes to Dota 2,
    and with large prize pools, major teams come knocking. <br/><br/>`,

    `The event will be the LAN debut of Team Secret’s new-look roster, after the close-season additions
    of young Polish carry Michał 'Nisha' Jankowski and the Swede, Ludwig 'zai' Wåhlberg. <br/> <br/><br/>
    <h4>The best of the rest?</h4>
    Joining PSG.LGD and Secret are a third invited team, Fnatic. Daryl 'iceiceice' Koh will be looking to make a splash
    in his home country, and will certainly have the backing of a partisan crowd. <br/> <br/>

    Five of the other six teams in the SEA-focused event have all gone through qualifiers to earn their spots:
    <br/> <br/>
    — KSY, Australia
    — Team Admiral, Philippines
    — Resurgence, Singapore
    — Hashtag, Thailand
    — Signify, India
    — BOOM ID, winners of the Indonesia Games Championship 2018
    <br/><br/><br/>`,

    `
    <h4>Three stages to glory</h4>

    To kick things off, the six qualifiers will take part in a best-of-one round robin Group Stage.
    The teams finishing in the top three positions will then move on to the Playoff Group Stage.
    <br/><br/>
    Here, the three invited teams join the party. Due to the uneven nature of the event, a draw will
    be made to determine which groups the invited teams will populate.
    <br/><br/>
    Group A will be made up of the first and second place teams from the Group Stage, along with one
    invite, while Group B will feature the other two direct invites alongside the third place team from the round robin.
    <br/><br/>
    The top two teams from each of these groups will then move on to a single-elimination bracket —
    the semi-finals being played as a best-of-three series, and the Grand Finals a best-of-five.
    <br/><br/>

    Who do you think will come out on top? `]
